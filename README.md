# Library App

**PROJECT SUMMARY:**

The aim for this project was to build a web application that allows a user to keep a track of what books they have read in a grid like format. Books can then be toggled as read/unread and deleted from the display. Users should also be able to add a book to the display by clicking an add book form that prompts the user to fill out a form for the book they would like to add.

It is NOT intended for the app to store the data permanently - just temporarily while the user is viewing the page. I imagine I may revisit this project at a later date once I am equipped with the required knowledge to do this. 

_**Some of the things I have learned from completing this project:**_

- Using CSS Grid to create the layout of the page, particularly the responsive nature where I can use the autofill CSS function to add as many cards as possible to each row before wrapping onto the next row.

- I learned how objects can be created in JavaScript and how they can be used as data structures. Each book that exists on the page exists as an instance of the 'Book' object. All of the book objects are stored inside an array.

- This project allowed me to consolidate a lot of the key concepts I have learned throughout my programming journey so far. Key concepts such as function based programming, using arrays and manipulating the DOM through the use of JavaScript.

_**Some of the challenges I faced during this project:**_

- One of the biggest challenges I faced in this project was updating the cards with a new value and displaying this to the user. I soon learned that to achieve this I would need to reset the display by removing the cards from the display and then adding them back. I was pleased to find out that this does not show visually as it is done instantly, giving the effect that it was updating just the card that was clicked.

- Working with objects and understanding the scope of functions took some getting used to. Coming from working predominantly in Python, I took some time during this project to adapt to some of the differences and similarities between the languages.

_**If I was to spend more time on this project I would:**_

- Create a solution that allows for the data entered into the app to be stored permanently for users. This will be possible once I have a better understanding of how databases work.
